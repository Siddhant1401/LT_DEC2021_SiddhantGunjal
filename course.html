        <p>We offer the following Diploma, Undergraduate and Postgraduate Degree Programs</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Diploma</h3>
                <p>A diploma is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as college or
                    university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of
                    study. The word diploma also refers to an academic award which is given after the completion of
                    study in different courses such as diploma in higher education, diploma in graduation or diploma in
                    post-graduation. Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document,thus
                    diplomatic,diplomatand diplomacy via the Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Undergraduate</h3>
                <p>Undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and prior to postgraduate
                    education. It typically includes all postsecondary programs up to the level of a bachelor's degree.
                    For example, in the United States, an entry-level university student is known as an undergraduate,
                    while students of higher degrees are known as graduate students. In some other educational systems,
                    undergraduate education is postsecondary education up to the level of a master's degree; this is the
                    case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="course-col">
                <h3>Post Graduation</h3>
                <p>Postgraduate education (graduate education in North America) involves learning and studying for
                    academic or professional degrees, academic or professional certificates, academic or professional
                    diplomas, or other qualifications for which a first or bachelor's degree generally is required, and
                    it is normally considered to be part of higher education. In North America, this level is typically
                    referred to as graduate school (and often colloquially as grad school).</p>
